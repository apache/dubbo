/**
 * Extension for intercepting the invocation for both service provider and consumer, furthermore, most of
 * functions in dubbo are implemented base on the same mechanism. Since every time when remote method is
 * invoked, the filter extensions will be executed too, the corresponding penalty should be considered before
 * more filters are added.
 * <pre>
 *  They way filter work from sequence point of view is
 *    <b>
 *    ...code before filter ...
 *          invoker.invoke(invocation) //filter work in a filter implementation class
 *          ...code after filter ...
 *    </b>
 *    Caching is implemented in dubbo using filter approach. If cache is configured for invocation then before
 *    remote call configured caching type's (e.g. Thread Local, JCache etc) implementation invoke method gets called.
 * </pre>
 * Filter. (SPI, Singleton, ThreadSafe)
