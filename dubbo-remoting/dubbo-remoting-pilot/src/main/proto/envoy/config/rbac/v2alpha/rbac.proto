// [#protodoc-title: Role Based Access Control (RBAC)]

// Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides service-level and method-level access control for a
// service. RBAC policies are additive. The policies are examined in order. A request is allowed
// once a matching policy is found (suppose the `action` is ALLOW).
//
// Here is an example of RBAC configuration. It has two policies:
//
// * Service account "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/admin" has full access to the service, and so
//   does "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/superuser".
//
// * Any user can read ("GET") the service at paths with prefix "/products", so long as the
//   destination port is either 80 or 443.
//
//  .. code-block:: yaml
//
//   action: ALLOW
//   policies:
//     "service-admin":
//       permissions:
//         - any: true
//       principals:
//         - authenticated:
//             principal_name:
//               exact: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/admin"
//         - authenticated:
//             principal_name:
//               exact: "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/superuser"
//     "product-viewer":
//       permissions:
//           - and_rules:
//               rules:
//                 - header: { name: ":method", exact_match: "GET" }
//                 - header: { name: ":path", regex_match: "/products(/.*)?" }
//                 - or_rules:
//                     rules:
