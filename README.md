Apache Dubbo is an easy-to-use Web and RPC framework that provides multiple
language implementations(Java, [Go](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-go), [Rust](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-rust), [Node.js](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-js), [Web](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-js)) for communication, service discovery, traffic management,
observability, security, tools, and best practices for building enterprise-ready microservices.

Visit [the official website](https://dubbo.apache.org/) for more information.

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://dubbo.apache.org/imgs/architecture.png)

* Consumer and provider communicate with each other using RPC protocol like triple, tcp, rest, etc.
* Consumers automatically trace provider instances registered in registries(Zookeeper, Nacos) and distribute traffic among them by following traffic strategies.
* Rich features for monitoring and managing the cluster with dynamic configuration, metrics, tracing, security, and visualized console.

## Getting started
Follow the instructions below to learn how to:

### Programming with lightweight RPC API
[5 minutes step-by-step guide](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/quickstart/rpc/java)

Dubbo supports building RPC services with only a few lines of code while depending only on a lightweight SDK (<10MB). The protocol on the wire can be [Triple](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/reference/protocols/triple/)(fully gRPC compatible and HTTP-friendly), Dubbo2(TCP), REST, or any protocol of your choice.


### Building a microservice application with Spring Boot
[5 minutes step-by-step guide](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/quickstart/microservice)

It's highly recommended to start your microservice application with the Spring Boot Starter `dubbo-spring-boot-starter` provided by Dubbo. With only a single dependency and yaml file, and optionally a bunch of other useful spring boot starters, you can enable all of the Dubo features like service discovery, observability, tracing, etc.

Next, learn how to [deploy](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/tasks/deploy/), [monitor](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/tasks/observability/), and [manage the traffic](https://dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/tasks/traffic-management/) of your Dubbo application and cluster.
